# TeamRide
An app for connecting people seeking cabs in crowded environments that
enables them to get in touch with each other and share cabs.

## User Workflow
* Open the app
* Add the destination in the **I want to go to...** field, move the pin around to set the address, and click **next**.
* Click the **Camera** button, take a selfie, and add your public name in the **I am ...** field.
* If there are users looking for riders heading in that direction, swipe left or right to join them in a chat.
* If you're the only user heading to that area, wait in the chat window for other riders to join your ride.
* In case a user decides to join your ride, you can accept or reject them.
* Upon acceptance, the user is automatically added to the group chat where you can figure out where to meet
* Once you find sufficient riders, you can figure out the taxi together
